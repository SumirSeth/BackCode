# BackCode | Home for the optimized backend head start codes

![Banner](./nick/banner.png)

I am building a shadcn for backend development. Detailed project structure and code for every file just copy paste to your project and give more focus to your core functionalities !!

## For the contribution part

I will be openeing few issues related to revamp of the website and db connections 

for now you can add projects just by editing the `projects.json` file in the root directory or by visiting the contribution panel of the platform

## Things to note

When your are contributing, there is place to fill `Link` section in this you need to give the dynaminc url of project like, If the user is contributing for a cache management then the link would look like this `/post/cache-management-{language}`

## Tech Stack

I have used NextJs and local json file to store all the files and codes.

## Future Releases ?? 

For the upcoming part we are enlisting few features
- Auth/OAuth 
- DB (Supabase obv)
- Users can save the post and the codes, like, leave comments and discuss
